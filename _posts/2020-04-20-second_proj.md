title: Scraping the Web with my beloved Minnesota Timberwolves
---

The Metis Chicago data science bootcamp has soldiered on, we're continuing to stack skills on top of skills as we progress quickly through the curriculum.  After the initial shock of the first couple of days, my body's rhythm adjusted during week two and I'm beginning to get into the swing of things more easily.

Our second project had us return to pandas work and our friends, the dataframes. Coming around this time however, we were given the freedom to choose our own data sets and pursue some interests of our own.  It seems this both hurt and hindered when it came to searching the immense world wide web for data that we needed. The subject I chose is my favorite team of all time, the Minnesota Timberwolves. The data used was game logs from 2012-2020 as I focused on the key non-scoring stats a basketball squad needs to predict the plus/minus outcome for their next game.

**Some challenges I ran into:**
* choosing the right stats to build a somewhat "accurate" model
* being able to find game logs of higher concept individual stats such as box outs and distance traveled
* continuing to futz around with my data and not plunging into the munging and transformation quicker

**Positives I enjoyed:**
* easily scraping basketball-reference.com using a combination of BeautifulSoup and pandas
* feeling sad about my r^2 values until realizing the cold, hard truth is that the Timberwolves have been inconsistent over the past decade, explaining the variance in the model
* deploying my domain knowledge with the game of basketball to be able to explain my findings to the cohort during my presentation


Completing a project like this makes me want to only find more data, better data, and go back in and fine tune my model more. I will go back to it at some point, but for now I'm practicing an imperative lesson we've also learned during our first three weeks....and that's to turn it in cause it's due, not because it's "perfect". Onwards and upwards, to bigger and biggerer data.

Catch y'all on round the bend....
