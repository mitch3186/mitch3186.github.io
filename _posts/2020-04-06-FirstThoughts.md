title: Brink's Maiden Voyage on the MTA
---

Coming from the world of video marketing and creative copywriting, week of the Metis data science bootcamp was a classic butt-kicker. I experienced roller coaster speed peaks and valleys of confidence and fear during the application process. That is why on day one when Alice, one of our hero instructors, spoke about imposter syndrome, that tight feeling in my chest subsided, briefly. It returned when I learned the amount of knowledge I was to absorb and attempt to retain during our first week. 

Remember back, back to the days of junior high when you wore your favorite outfit and gelled your hair just so to impress the kids at school on that first day back from summer. The muscles you hadn't been flexing are rusty, dusted with cobwebs but fear not they disappeared quickly. Starting bootcamp with languages I had never learned was just like those junior high days, but now I use molding clay, and my summer was a solid decade. That first night I slept like a baby log, the resources depleted from my backups. The next morning refreshed and ready to tackle problems anew. The first ride we'd go on as a group - sadly the only technical group journey during the bootcamp - was with NYC's MTA. The data wrangled, munged, and then munged again when we noticed a prankster MTA employee had told the counter to reverse. And whoa, how many 23rd St stations are there? Sidebar: Which one has that great dive bar near it that was owned in the late 70s by the second baseman from the 1936 pennant winning Yankee squad? 

It has been a challenge dealing with all of these concepts flying fast at my face but just as with any other skill, waking up clear headed, even keeled and ready to continue forth, the picture will come into focus. And soon you'll know what you're looking at.
